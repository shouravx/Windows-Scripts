# DriverDex

**Automatic Hardware Driver Detector & Installer**
Scans your hardware, checks it against the DriverDex database, and only bothers you about what actually needs attention.

## Quick Start

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shouravx/driverdex/refs/heads/main/DriverDex-Installer.ps1 | iex
```

Run that in PowerShell (Admin recommended — it'll offer to self-elevate if you don't). That's it.

> Adjust the path above if the script lives somewhere other than the repo root — e.g. `.../main/installer/DriverDex-Installer.ps1`.

**Already have the file locally?**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\DriverDex-Installer.ps1"
```

## What it does

1. Scans every PnP hardware device on your system
2. Queries the DriverDex API for matching drivers
3. Cross-checks what's *already* installed — by hardware ID, not just provider name
4. Shows you a table with each driver tagged `NEW`, `UPDATE`, `INSTALLED`, or `NEWER INSTALLED`
5. Pre-selects only what actually needs action (`SMART` mode) — you can still force `ALL`, `PROBLEMS`, or pick by number
6. Downloads (SHA-256 verified), extracts, and installs via `pnputil`
7. If your hardware isn't in the database yet, invites you to contribute it — anonymously, opt-in, no account needed
